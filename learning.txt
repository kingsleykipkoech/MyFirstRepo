The most significant lesson learned is that true terminal power comes from integration and debugging, not just installation. I successfully built a stable Zsh environment, configured complex tools like GitHub Copilot CLI and FZF, and resolved multiple path and alias conflicts. This confirmed my understanding of the fundamental Git workflow (Clone, Add, Commit, Push) and the importance of having a clean, reliable .zshrc file for future productivity.
